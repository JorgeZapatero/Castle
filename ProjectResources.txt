Making makefiles:
   www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/makefiles.html

How the castle is drawn:
   The divisions between the bricks are calculated by the function...
   C(x) = R * cos((x + N + f/F) * PI / N) + R
      
   where...

   R = radius of castle
   N = number of "bricks"
   x = a given brick border to be drawn (between 0 and N-1)
   F = total number of frames in the animation
   f = current animation frame (between 0 and F-1)
   C(x) = the x coordinate where ya gotta draw a vertical brick border
   
   I found this function myself through trial and error.

How the shading works:
   As the apparent length of each brick approaches 0, the brick gets darker.

How the animation is rendered:
   The castle.ps file is controlled by the variables 'nFrames' and 'cFrames'.
      There is a python script that goes into the file, sets nFrames once
      and renders a .png for each "current" frame (between 0 and n-1)

Makefile:
   The makefile glues the  command line, castle.ps, ghostscript,
   and imagemagick together
      Enter "make" and that's it!
